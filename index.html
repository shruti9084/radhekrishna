        Krishna is referred to as Svayam Bhagavan and Radha is illustrated as the primeval potency of the three main potencies of God, Hladini (immense spiritual bliss), Sandhini (eternality), and Samvit (existential consciousness), of which Radha is an embodiment of the feeling of love towards Krishna.
       <br> <br> With Krishna, Radha is acknowledged as the Supreme Goddess. Krishna is said to be satiated only by devotional service in loving servitude, personified by Radha. Various devotees worship her to attain Krishna via her. Radha is also depicted to be Krishna himself, split into two for the purpose of his enjoyment. As per scriptures, Radha is considered as the complete incarnation of Mahalakshmi.
       <br> <br> It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha enchants even him. Therefore, she is the supreme goddess of all, and together they are called Radha-Krishna. In many Vaishnava sections, Radha Krishna are often identified as the avatars of Lakshmi Narayana.
       <br> <br> Radha Krishna can be broken into two: Krishna (Devanagari: कृष्ण), the incarnation of Vishnu, which means, "all attractive" or "dark blue", and his shakti Radha (Devanagari: राधा), the incarnation of Lakshmi, which means "the pleasing one".
       <br> <br> Many significant epithets accorded to Krishna including - Radha Ramana and Radha Vallabh, which means "the lover and the beloved of Radha" are directly derived from the name of his consort, Radha. Similarly, epithets of Radha including - Krishna Kanta, which means "the consort of Krishna" and Krishna Vallabha, which means "the eternal companion of Krishna", are directly associated with the name of Krishna.
